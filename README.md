# Seq2Seq Forecasting
This repository includes a basic outline of code used for time series forecasting using sequence to sequence models. The data included is from Gefcom 2014. The main component of this is in `graph_creating.py`, which is used to generate the appropriate TensorFlow computational graphs.

These notebooks are not enough to produce all results, but they should be adequate to get a sense of how to run the code.
